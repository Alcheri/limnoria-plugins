Limnoria (an IRC bot) plugins I wrote or forked. All working under Python 3. 

Requires [Limnoria](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria), obviously. Additional requirements in requirements.txt files

Plugins assume Python 3.6+, though many may still work with older versions.

Easy installation:

load PluginDownloader<br />
repolist oddluck<br />
install oddluck PluginName<br />
load PluginName<br />
