This plugin will be a feature packed trivia script for [Supybot][] in the future. Developers will need to refer to [TriviaTime][] for more information.
This plugin cannot do anything yet. The project has not yet started.

# Plans
## Main Priority

* seperate hints by 15 seconds each

* Auto-voice weekly/monthly/yearly top players

* allow shuffling of questions

* add skip action, requires at least half of active players in the past 10 minutes

* extra points for streaks

* create live PHP website showing scores and to track reports

and much more, based off of BogusTrivia and Trivia (supybot plugin)
