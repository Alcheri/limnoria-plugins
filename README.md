This plugin will be a feature packed trivia script for [Supybot][] in the future. Developers will need to refer to [TriviaTime][] for more information.
This plugin has been started but is not finished. For developers use only. Not ready for use.

# Plans
## Main Priority

* seperate hints by 15 seconds each

* Seperate new questions by 15 seconds

* Hints should dispaly random letters in the word instead of left to right

* New Style design to remove all colors and use bold

* Auto-voice weekly/monthly/yearly top players

* allow shuffling of questions

* add skip action, requires at least half of active players in the past 10 minutes

* extra points for streaks

* create live PHP website showing scores and to track reports

and much more, based off of BogusTrivia and Trivia (supybot plugin)
