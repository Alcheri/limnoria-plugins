This is a DuckHunt game for supybot
Start a hunt with the "start" command.
Once the hunt is started, the bot will launch a duck from time to time.
The first person that shoots the duck (with the "bang" command) gets one point.
When someone shoots when there is no duck (or the duck has already been shot), he loses one point.
Scores as well as best times are saved per channel and you can display them at anytime with the "listscores" and "listtimes" commands.
