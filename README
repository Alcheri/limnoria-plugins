Supybot Word Games Plugin
=========================

A few word games to play in IRC with Supybot!

These games rely on a dictionary file, default 'words.txt' in the directory
where supybot runs.  It should consist of one word per line.  The location of
this file can be set with config plugins.Wordgames.wordFile.

Commands:

    wordshrink [length]
    Start a new WordShrink game.

    wordtwist [length]
    Start a new WordTwist game.

    wordquit
    Give up on any currently running game.

A puzzle will be presented in the form a > --- > --- > d, and your job is to
come up with a response of the form b > c.  (You can optionally include the
start and end words in your response, as long as each word is separated by a
greater-than sign.)

The goal of both games is to change the word by one letter until you have
turned the starting word into the ending word.  In WordShrink, you must remove
one letter and rearrange the letters to form a new word.  In WordTwist, you
must change exactly one letter (no re-arranging) to form a new word.
