Supybot Word Games Plugin
=========================

A few word games to play in IRC with Supybot!

These games rely on a dictionary file (not included).  On Ubuntu, you can
normally just install the 'wamerican' package.  See the configurable variables
to customize.

Configuration:

  plugins.Wordgames.wordFile:
    Path to the dictionary file.

    Default: /usr/share/dict/american-english

  plugins.Wordgames.wordRegexp:
    A regular expression defining what a valid word looks like.  This will
    be used to filter words from the dictionary file that contain undesirable
    characters (proper names, hyphens, accents, etc.).  You will probably have
    to quote the string when setting, e.g.:

       @config plugins.Wordgames.wordRegexp "^[a-x]+$"
       (No words containing 'y' or 'z' would be allowed by this.)

    Default: ^[a-z]+$

  plugins.Wordgames.worddleDelay
    The length (in seconds) of the pre-game period where players can join a
    new Worddle game.

    Default: 15

  plugins.Wordgames.worddleDuration
    The length (in seconds) of the active period of a Worddle game, when
    players can submit guesses.

    Default: 90

Commands:

  worddle
    Start a new Worddle game. Use "worddle join" to join a game that someone
    else has started.

  wordshrink [difficulty]
    Start a new WordShrink game.  Difficulty values: [easy] medium hard evil

  wordtwist [difficulty]
    Start a new WordTwist game.  Difficulty values: [easy] medium hard evil

  wordquit
    Give up on any currently running game.

Game Rules:

Worddle is a clone of a well-known puzzle game involving a 4x4 grid of
randomly-placed letters.  Find words on the board by starting at a particular
letter and moving to adjacent letters (in all 8 directions, diagonals ok).
Words must be 3 letters or longer to be considered.  At the end of the game,
if a word was found by multiple players, it is not counted.  The remaining
words contribute to your score (1 point per letter).

WordShrink and WordTwist are word chain (or word ladder) style games.
A puzzle will be presented in the form:

  a > --- > --- > d

... and your job is to come up with a response of the form b > c.  (You can
optionally include the start and end words in your response, as long as each
word is separated by a greater-than sign.)

In WordShrink, you remove one letter from each successive word and rearrange
the letters to form a new word.  Example session:

  <mike> @wordshrink
  <supybot> WordShrink: lights > ----- > ---- > sit
  <supybot> (12 possible solutions)
  <mike> sight > this
  <supybot> WordShrink: mike got it!
  <supybot> WordShrink: lights > sight > this > sit
  <ben> lights > hilts > hits > sit
  <supybot> ben: Your solution is also valid.

In WordTwist, you change exactly one letter in each successive word to form a
new word (no rearranging).  Example session:

  <mike> @wordtwist medium
  <supybot> WordTwist: mass > ---- > ---- > ---- > jade
  <supybot> (5 possible solutions)
  <mike> mars > mare > made
  <supybot> WordTwist: mike got it!
  <supybot> WordTwist: mass > mars > mare > made > jade
